To build this project, run "make" in this directory (the project root). 
It is assumed that GNU Make is installed, along with Flex and Bison. An 
executable named "lab4" will be generated.

The program accepts C-Minus code from the standard input and prints the 
generated GAS-syntax x86 assembly code to the standard output. The code 
can be run, but must be called by another program, such as a C program. 
Functions in the C-Minus program can be declared and called from the C 
code as external functions (e.g.: "int g(int a[], int b)" in C-Minus 
code would have a prototype "extern int g(int a[], int b)" in calling C 
code). Functions use the standard Linux calling convention, so return 
values can be accessed by the C caller.
